Enhancing e-commerce with AI Assistant and deep linking.

## App Description
King's Store app is a functional prototype for an online shoe store featuring a personalized AI Sales assistant. It aims to elevate the customer experience, boost sales, and streamline operations by reducing the customer service workload. By leveraging Gemini million context powered by Gemini Flash, customers are able to have a clearer insight of the products available for sale on the platform and can go as far as purchasing directly from the prompt without having to go through them one by one. Furthermore, with the deep linking layer built on top of the Gemini response, customers have the flexibility to navigate the app directly from the prompt based on conversations with the model.
